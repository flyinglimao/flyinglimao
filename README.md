### Hello there
I'm Yu-Chen (Bill) Wu, a frontend engineer in [Crypto-Arsenal](https://crypto-arsenal.io), a MS student at [NCCU CS](https://www.cs.nccu.edu.tw), and the founder of [VariaNFT](https://varianft.studio). In graduate school, I'm focusing on blockchain and relevent cryptography technology such as Zero-Knowledge.
